# ENGRD380-Fall24
Writing with Language Models
Emory University / ENGRD380 / Fall 2024

Language models, generative AI, and other writing machines have become widespread and more effective, but our strategies, reasons, and concerns about writing with them are still nascent.  This course gives students opportunities to experiment writing with language models and to explore the history of writing machines and computational models of narrative.
